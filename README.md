# docker image to optimize images with [optimizt](https://github.com/343dev/optimizt) automatically

in combination from [optimizt](https://github.com/343dev/optimizt) and [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)

## usage

point a path to '/src/input' as input folder
point a path to '/src/output' as outgoing folder

Files that “optimizt” can process are processed and stored in the output folder.
Files that cannot be optimized are moved directly to the output folder.
